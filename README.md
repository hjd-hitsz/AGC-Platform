# AGC-Platform
AGC-Platform, named after Aerial-Ground Cooperation Platform, is aimed to provide an unified simulation environment in Gazebo for testing cooperative behavior between UAV and UGV. 
# UGV Platform
We adopt a mature work which integrates multiple sensors to a Scout2 robot including Realsense camera, Velodyne lidar and IMU, from https://github.com/linzs-online/robot_gazebo.
